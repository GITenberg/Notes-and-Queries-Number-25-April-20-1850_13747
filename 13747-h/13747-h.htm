<h3>OUR FURTHER PROGRESS.</h3>
<p>We have again been called upon to reprint our first Four
Numbers; that is to say, to print a <i>Third Edition</i> of them.
No stronger evidence could be afforded that our endeavour to do
good service to the cause of sound learning, by affording to Men of
Letters a medium of intercommunication, has met with the sympathy
and encouragement of those for whose sake we made the trial. We
thank them heartily for their generous support, and trust we shall
not be disappointed in our hope and expectation that they will find
their reward in the growing utility of "NOTES AND QUERIES," which,
thanks to the readiness with which able correspondents pour out
their stores of learning, may be said to place the judicious
inquirer in the condition of Posthumus, and</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Puts to him all the learnings that <i>this</i> time</p>
<p>Could make him the receiver of."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And here we may be permitted to avail ourselves of this
opportunity, as, indeed, we feel compelled to do, to impress upon
our correspondents generally, the necessity of confining their
communications within the narrowest possible limits consistent with
a satisfactory explanation of the immediate objects of them. "He
that questioneth much," says Bacon, "shall learn much, and content
much; but especially if he apply his Questions to the skill of the
Persons whom he asketh. For he shall give them occasion to please
themselves in speaking, and himself shall continually gather
knowledge. But let his Questions not be troublesome, for that is
fit for a Poser; and let him be sure <i>to leave other Men their
turn to speak</i>." What Bacon has said so wisely and so well, "OF
DISCOURSE," we would apply to our little Journal; and beg our kind
friends to remember, that our space is necessarily limited, and
that, therefore, in our eyes, Brevity will be as much the Soul of a
communication as it is said to be that of Wit.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>ROGER BACON: HINTS AND QUERIES FOR A NEW EDITION OF HIS
WORKS.</h3>
<p>Victor Cousin, who has been for many years engaged in researches
on the scholastic philosophy, with the view of collecting and
publishing such of its monuments as have escaped the diligence of
scholars, or the ravages of time, has lately made the discovery in
the library at Douay of a copy of an inedited MS. of Roger Bacon,
entitled <i>Opus Tertium</i>, of which but two or three other
copies are known to exist; and has taken occasion, in some
elaborate critiques, to enter, at considerable length, into the
history and character of Roger <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page394" id="page394"></a>{394}</span> Bacon and his
writings.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> The following is a summary of part of
M. Cousin's observations.</p>
<p>The <i>Opus Tertium</i> contains the author's last revision, in
the form of an abridgment and improvement, of the <i>Opus
Majus</i>; and was drawn up at the command of Pope Clement IV., and
so called from being the <i>third</i> of three copies forwarded to
his holiness; the third copy being not a <i>fac-simile</i> of the
others, but containing many most important additions, particularly
with regard to the reformation of the calendar. It also throws much
light on Bacon's own literary history and studies, and the
difficulties and persecutions he had to surmount from the
jealousies and suspicions of his less-enlightened contemporaries
and rivals. The <i>Opus Tertium</i>, according to the sketch given
of its contents by Bacon himself, is not complete either in the
Douay MS. or in that in the British Museum, several subjects being
left out; and, among others, that of Moral Philosophy. This
deficiency may arise, either from Bacon not having completed his
original design, or from no complete MS. of this portion of his
writings having yet been discovered. M. Cousin says, that the
<i>Opus Tertium</i>, as well as the <i>Opus Minus</i>, is still
inedited; and is only known by what Jebb has said of it in his
preface to the <i>Opus Majus</i>. Jebb quotes it from a copy in the
Cottonian Library, now in the British Museum; and it was not known
that there was a copy in France, till M. Cousin was led to the
discovery of one, by observing in the Catalogue of the public
library of Douay, a small MS. in 4to. with the following title,
<i>Rog. Baconis Grammatica Gr&aelig;ca</i>. Accustomed to suspect
the accuracy of such titles to MSS., M. Cousin caused a strict
examination of the MS. to be made, when the discovery was
communicated to him that only the first part of the MS. consisted
of a Greek grammar, and that the remaining portion, which the
compiler of the Catalogue had not taken the trouble to examine,
consisted of many fragments of other works of Bacon, and a copy of
the <i>Opus Tertium</i>. This copy of the <i>Opus Tertium</i> is
imperfect, but fortunately the deficiencies are made up by the
British Museum copy, which M. Cousin examined, and which also
contains a valuable addition to Chapter I., and a number of good
readings.</p>
<p>The <i>Opus Majus</i>, as published by Jebb, contains but six
parts; but the work in its complete state had originally a seventh
part, containing Moral Philosophy, which was reproduced, in an
abridged and improved state, by the renowned author, in the <i>Opus
Tertium</i>. This is now ascertained, says M. Cousin, with
unquestionable certainty, and for the first time, from the
examination of the Douay MS.; which alludes, in the most precise
terms, to the treatise on that subject. Hence the importance of
endeavouring to discover what has become of the MS. Treatise of
Moral Philosophy mentioned by Jebb, on the authority of Bale and
Pits, as it is very likely to have been the seventh part of the
<i>Opus Majus</i>. Jebb published the <i>Opus Majus</i> from a
Dublin MS., collated with other MSS.; but he gives no description
of that MS., only saying that it contained many other works
attributed to Bacon, and in such an order that they seemed to form
but one and the same work. It becomes necessary, therefore, to
ascertain what were the different works of Bacon included in the
Dublin MS.; which is, in all probability, the same mentioned as
being in Trinity College, in the <i>Catalogi Codicum Manuscriptorum
Angli&aelig; et Hiberni&aelig; in unum Collecti</i>: Folio. Oxon,
1697.</p>
<p>According to this Catalogue, a Treatise on Moral Philosophy
forms part of Roger Bacon's MSS. there enumerated; and if so, why
did Jebb suppress it in his edition of the <i>Opus Majus</i>?
Perhaps some of your correspondents in Dublin may think it worth
the trouble to endeavour to clear up this difficulty, on which M.
Cousin lays great stress; and recommends, at the same time, a new
and complete edition of the <i>Opus Majus</i> to the patriotism of
some Oxford or Cambridge Savant. He might well have included Dublin
in his appeal for help in this undertaking; which, he says, would
throw a better light on that vast, and not very intelligible
monument of one of the most independent and greatest minds of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<h3>CRAIK'S ROMANCE OF THE PEERAGE.</h3>
<p>If I knew where to address Mr. G.L. Craik, I should send him the
following "Note:" if you think it deserves a place in your columns,
it may probably meet his eye.</p>
<p>In the article on the Lady Arabella Stuart (<i>Romance of the
Peerage</i>, vol. ii. p. 370.), a letter of Sir Ralph Winwood,
dated 1610, is quoted, in which he states, that she is "not
altogether free from suspicion of being collapsed." On this Mr.
Craik observes, "It is difficult to conjecture what can be here
meant by <i>collapsed</i>, unless it be fallen off to Romanism."
Now it is not a little curious, and it proves Mr. Craik's
capability for the task of illustrating family history from the
obscure allusions in letters and documents, that there exists
cotemporary authority for fixing the meaning Mr. Craik has
conjectured to be the true one, to the word <i>collapsed</i>. A
pamphlet, with the title <i>A Letter to Mr. T.H., late Minister,
now Fugitive</i>, was published in 1609, with a dedication to all
Romish <i>collapsed</i> "ladies of Great Britain;" which bears
internal evidence of being addressed to those who were converts
from the Church of England to Romanism.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id=
"page395"></a>{395}</span>
<p>Theophilus Higgons, whom the above initials represent, was
himself a convert to the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>It may be worth while making a further note, that the copy of
the pamphlet before me belonged to Camden, and is described in his
autograph, <i>Guil. Camdenj. Ex. dono Authoris</i>. It forms one of
a large collection of tracts and pamphlets, originally the property
of Camden, which are now in the library of the dean and chapter
here.</p>
<p>It is curious that another document quoted by Mr. Craik in the
same volume (p. 286 <i>note</i>), seems to fix the meaning of a
word or expression, of obscure signification, in the authorised
translation of the Bible. In Judges, ix. 53., we read, "A certain
woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all
tobrake his skull." I have heard some one, in despair at the
grammatical construction of the latter clause, suggest that it
might be an error for "<i>also</i> brake his skull;" and I have
been told, that some printer or editor solved the difficulty by
turning it into "and all to <i>break</i> his skull." But in the
Lieutenant of the Tower's marginal notes on an inventory of the
Countess of Hertford's (Lady Katherine Grey) furniture, quoted by
Mr. Craik from Lands. MS. 5. art. 41., he described the
<i>sparrer</i> for the bed as "<i>all to-broken</i>, not worth ten
pence." There seems, therefore, to have been a compound, "to-breck,
to-brake, to-broken" (<i>perfrango</i>), of which the word in the
"Book of Judges" is the preterite. I may be exposing my ignorance,
when I say, that the quotation in the <i>Romance of the Peerage</i>
is the only other instance of its use I ever met with.</p>
<p class="author">WILLIAM H. COPE.</p>
<p>Cloisters, Westminster</p>
<p class="note">[The word "to-break," is not to be found in
Nares.&mdash;Mr. Halliwell, in his <i>Archaic Dictionary</i>, has
TO-BROKE, broken in pieces:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The gates that Neptunus made</p>
<p>A thousand wynter theretofore,</p>
<p>They have anon <i>to-broke</i> and tore."</p>
<p class="i2">From the <i>Gower MS</i>. Soc. Ant. 134, f. 46.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="note">The word occurs also in Chaucer (p. 549. ed.
Urry):&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"To-broken ben the Statutes hie in heven;"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="note">and also in the <i>Vision of Piers Ploughman</i>
(p. 156. ed. Wright):</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The bagges and the bigirdles</p>
<p>He hath to-broke them all."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="note">And Mr. Wright very properly remarks, that
"<i>to</i>- prefixed in composition to verbs of Anglo-Saxon origin,
has the same force as the German <i>zu</i>, giving to the word the
idea of destruction or deterioration."]</p>
<hr />
<h3>NOTES UPON CUNNINGHAM'S HANDBOOK FOR LONDON.</h3>
<p><i>Lambeth Wells.</i>&mdash;A place of public entertainment,
first opened in 1697. It was celebrated for its mineral water,
which was sold at one penny per quart. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century it was provided with a band of music, which
played at intervals during the day, and the price of admission was
threepence. A monthly concert, under the direction of Starling
Goodwin, organist of St. Saviour's church, Southwark, was held here
in 1727.</p>
<p><i>Hickford's Rooms, Panton Street, Haymarket.</i>&mdash;These
rooms, under the name of "Hickford's Dancing Rooms," were in
existence as early as 1710. In 1738, they were opened as the
"Musick-room." A contemporary account says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The band was selected from the Opera House; but the singularity
most attractive consisted of an organ combined with a harpsichord,
played by clock-work, which exhibited the movements of an orrery
and air-pump, besides solving astronomical and geographical
problems on two globes, and showing the moon's age, with the
Copernican system in motion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1740, Mr. Galliard's benefit is announced to take place "at
Mr. Hickford's Great Room in Brewer Street, Golden
Square."&mdash;See the <i>Daily Post</i> of March 31. The "Great
Room" is now known as "Willis's Dancing Academy."</p>
<p><i>The Music Room in Dean Street, Soho.</i>&mdash;The Oratorio
of Judas Maccabeus was performed here in great splendour in 1760.
It was afterwards the auction room of the elder Christie; and is
now "Caldwell's Dancing Academy." George III. frequently honoured
this "musick-room" with his presence.</p>
<p><i>The Music Room in Charles Street, Covent
Garden</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Consort of Musick, lately in Bow Street, is removed next
Bedford Gate, in <i>Charles Street, Covent Garden</i>, where a room
is newly built for that purpose."&mdash;<i>Lond. Gaz.</i> Feb. 19.
1690.</p>
<p>"A Consort of Music, with several new voices, to be performed on
the 10th instant, at the <i>Vendu</i> in Charles Street, Covent
Garden."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> March 6. 1691.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1693 was published <i>Thesaurus Musicus</i>, being a
Collection of the "Newest Songs performed at their Majesties'
Theatres, and at the Consorts in Villier Street, in York Buildings,
and in <i>Charles Street, Covent Garden</i>."</p>
<p>In the proposals for the establishment of a Royal Academy in
1720, the subscription books are advertised as being open, amongst
other places, "at the Musick Room in Charles Street, Covent
Garden."</p>
<p><i>Coleman's Music House.</i>&mdash;A house of entertainment,
with a large and well planted garden, known as "Coleman's Musick
House," was offered for sale in 1682. It was situated near
<i>Lamb's Conduit</i>, and was demolished upon the building of
Ormond Street.</p>
<p><i>White Conduit House.</i>&mdash;The old tavern of this name
was erected in the reign of Charles I. The workmen are said to have
been regaling themselves upon the completion of the building, at
the instant the king was beheaded at Whitehall.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id=
"page396"></a>{396}</span>
<p><i>Goodman's Field Wells.</i>&mdash;A place of entertainment
established after the suppression of the theatre in this locality
in 1735.</p>
<p><i>Bride Lane, St. Bride's.</i>&mdash;The first meetings of the
Madrigal Society (established in 1741) were held at a public-house
in this lane, called "The Twelve Bells."</p>

<h3>POPE'S REVISION OF SPENCE'S ESSAY ON THE ODYSSEY.</h3>
<p>Spence's almost idolatrous admiration of, and devotion to, Pope,
is evident from the pains he took to preserve every little anecdote
of him that he could elicit from conversation with him, or with
those who knew him. Unfortunately, he had not Boswell's address and
talent for recording gossip, or the <i>Anecdotes</i> would have
been a much more racy book. Spence was certainly an amiable, but I
think a very weak man; and it appears to me that his learning has
been overrated. He might indeed have been well designated as "a
fiddle-faddle bit of sterling."</p>
<p>I have the original MS. of the two last Dialogues of the
<i>Essay on the Odyssey</i> as written by Spence, and on the first
page is the following note:&mdash;"The two last Evenings corrected
by Mr. Pope." On a blank page at the end, Spence has again
written:&mdash;"MS. of the two last Evenings corrected with Mr.
Pope's own hand, w'ch serv'd y'e Press, and is so mark'd as usual
by Litchfield."</p>
<p>This will elucidate Malone's note in his copy of the book, which
Mr. Bolton Corney has transcribed. I think the first three
dialogues were published in a little volume before Spence became
acquainted with Pope, and perhaps led to that acquaintance. Their
intercourse afterwards might supply some capital illustrations for
a new edition of Mr. Corney's curious chapter on <i>Camaraderie
Litt&eacute;raire</i>. The MS. copy of Spence's Essay bears
frequent marks of Pope's correcting hand by erasure and
interlineary correction, silently made. I transcribe the few
passages where the poet's revision of his critic are accompanied by
remarks.</p>
<p>In Evening the Fourth, Spence had written:&mdash;"It may be
inquired, too, how far this translation may make a wrong use of
terms borrowed from the arts and sciences, &amp;c. [The instances
are thus pointed out.] As where we read of a ship's crew, Od. 3.
548. The longitude, Od. 19. 350. Doubling the Cape, Od. 9. 90. Of
Architraves, Colonnades, and the like, Od. 3. 516." Pope has erased
this and the references, and says:&mdash;"<i>These are great
faults; pray don't point 'em out, but spare your servant</i>."</p>
<p>At p. 16. Spence had written:&mdash;"Yellow is a proper epithet
of fruit; but not of fruit that we say at the same time is ripening
into gold." Upon which Pope observes:&mdash;"I think yellow may be
s'd to ripen into gold, as gold is a deeper, fuller colour than
yellow." Again: "What is proper in one language, may not be so in
another. Were Homer to call the sea a thousand times by the title
of [Greek: porphureos], 'purple deeps' would not sound well in
English. The reason's evident: the word 'purple' among us is
confined to one colour, and that not very applicable to the deep.
Was any one to translate the <i>purpureis oloribus</i> of Horace,
'purple swans' would not be so literal as to miss the sense of the
author entirely." Upon which Pope has remarked:&mdash;"The sea is
actually of a deep purple in many places, and in many views."</p>
<p>Upon a passage in Spence's <i>Criticism</i>, at p. 45., Pope
says:&mdash;"I think this too nice." And the couplet objected to by
Spence&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secur'd,</p>
<p>With ribs of steel, and marble heart immur'd,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>he pronounced "very bad." And of some tumid metaphors he says,
"All too forced and over-charged."</p>
<p>At p. 51. Spence says:&mdash;"Does it not sound mean to talk of
lopping a man? of lopping away all his posterity? or of trimming
him with brazen sheers? Is there not something mean, where a
goddess is represented as beck'ning and waving her deathless hands;
or, when the gods are dragging those that have provok'd them to
destruction by the Links of fate?" Of the two first instances, Pope
says:&mdash;"Intended to be comic in a sarcastic speech." And of
the last:&mdash;"I think not at all mean, see the Greek." The
remarks are, however, expunged.</p>
<p>The longest remonstrance occurs at p. 6. of the Fifth Dialogue.
Spence had written:&mdash;"The <i>Odyssey</i>, as a moral poem,
exceeds all the writings of the ancients: it is perpetual in
forming the manners, and in instructing the mind; it sets off the
duties of life more fully as well as more agreeably than the
Academy or Lyceum. <i>Horace ventured to say thus much of the
Iliad, and certainly it may be more justly said of this later
production by the same hand</i>." For the words in Italics Pope has
substituted:&mdash;"Horace, who was so well acquainted with the
tenets of both, has given Homer's poems the preference to either:"
and says in a note:&mdash;"I think you are mistaken in limiting
this commendation and judgment of Horace to the <i>Iliad</i>. He
says it, at the beginning of his Epistle, of Homer in general, and
afterwards proposes both poems equally as examples of morality;
though the <i>Iliad</i> be mentioned first: but then
follows&mdash;'<i>Rursus quid virtus et quid sapientia possit,
Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulyssem</i>,' &amp;c. of the
Odyssey."</p>
<p>At p. 34. Spence says:&mdash;"There seems to be something mean
and awkward in this image:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'His <i>loose head</i> tottering as with wine opprest</p>
<p>Obliquely drops, and <i>nodding</i> knocks his breast.'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here Pope says:&mdash;"Sure these are good lines. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>{397}</span> They are
not mine." Of other passages which please him, he occasionally
says,&mdash;"This is good sense." And on one occasion, where Spence
had objected, he says candidly:&mdash;"This is bad,
indeed,"&mdash;"and this."</p>
<p>At p. 50. Spence writes:&mdash;"There's a passage which I
remember I was mightily pleased with formerly in reading
<i>Cervantes</i>, without seeing any reason for it at that time;
tho' I now imagine that which took me in it comes under this view.
Speaking of Don Quixote, the first time that adventurer came in
sight of the ocean, he expresses his sentiments on this occasion in
the following manner:&mdash;'He saw the sea, which he had never
seen before, and thought it much bigger than the river at
Salamanca.'" On this occasion Pope suggests,&mdash;"Dr. Swift's
fable to Ph&mdash;&mdash;s, of the two asses and Socrates."</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Charm for the Toothache.</i>&mdash;The charm which one of
your correspondents has proved to be in use in the south-eastern
counties of England, and another has shown to be practised at
Kilkenny, was also known more than thirty years ago in the north of
Scotland. At that time I was a school-boy at Aberdeen, and a
sufferer&mdash;probably it was in March or April, with an easterly
wind&mdash;from toothache. A worthy Scotchwoman told me, that the
way to be cured of my toothache was to find a charm for it in the
Bible. I averred, as your correspondent the curate did, that I
could not find any such charm. My adviser then repeated to me the
charm, which I wrote down from her dictation. Kind soul! she could
not write herself. It was pretty nearly in the words which your
correspondent has sent you. According to my recollection, it ran
thus:&mdash;"Peter sat upon a stone, weeping. And the Lord said
unto him, 'Peter, why weepest thou?' And he answered, and said,
'Lord, my tooth acheth.' And the Lord said unto him, 'Arise, Peter,
thy teeth shall ache no more.'" "Now," continued my instructress,
"if you gang home and put yon bit screen into your Bible, you'll
never be able to say again that you canna find a charm agin the
toothache i' the Bible." This was her version of the matter, and I
have no doubt it was the orthodox one; for, although one of the
most benevolent old souls I ever knew, she was also one of the most
ignorant and superstitious. I kept the written paper, not in my
Bible, but in an old pocket-book for many years, but it has
disappeared.</p>

<h3>THE DUKE OF MONMOUTH'S POCKET-BOOK.</h3>
<p>It is reasonable to conclude, that the article copied from
<i>Chambers' Edinburgh Journal</i>, in No. 13., furnishes the
strongest evidence that can be adduced in support of the opinion,
that the book in the possession of Dr. Anster is the one found on
the Duke of Monmouth when captured, after his defeat at Sedgemoor;
and, if so, it is impossible to admit the hypothesis, because a
portion of the contents of the real book has been given to the
world and contains matter far too important to have been passed
over by Dr. Anster, had it existed in his volume. In the 6th
edition of Dr. Welwood's <i>Memoirs of the most material
Transactions in England for the last Hundred Years preceding the
Revolution in 1688</i>, printed for "Tim. Goodwin, at the Queen's
Head, against St. Dunstan's Church, in Fleet Street, 1718," the
following passage is to be found at p. 147.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But of the most things above mentioned there is an infallible
proof extant under Monmouth's own hand, in a little pocket-book
which was taken with him and delivered to King James; which by an
accident, as needless to mention here, I have leave to copy and did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id=
"page398"></a>{398}</span> it in part. A great many dark passages
there are in it, and some clear enough that shall be eternally
buried for me: and perhaps it had been for King James's honour to
have committed them to the flames, as Julius C&aelig;sar is said to
have done on a like occasion. All the use that shall be made of it
is, to give in the Appendix some few passages out of it that refer
to this subject, and confirm what has been above related."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Appendix the following extracts are given from the Duke's
book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>October</i> 13. L. came to me at eleven at night from 29,
told me 29 could never be brought to believe I knew anything of
that part of the plot that concern'd <i>Rye House</i>; but as
things went he must behave himself as if he did believe it, for
some reasons that might be for my advantage. L. desired me to write
to 29, which I refus'd; but afterwards told me 29 expected it; and
I promis'd to write to-morrow if he could call for the letter; at
which S.L. shew'd a great concern for me, and I believe him sincere
though S is of another mind.</p>
<p>"14. L. came as he promis'd and receiv'd the letter from 3
sealed, refusing to read it himself, tho' I had left it open with
S. for that purpose.</p>
<p>"20. L. came to me at S. with a line or two from 29 very kind,
assuring me he believed every word in my letter to be true; and
advis'd me to keep hid till he had an opportunity to express his
belief of it some other way. L. told me that he was to go out of
town next day and that 29 would send 80 to me in a day or two, whom
he assured me I might trust.</p>
<p>"25. L. came for me to &mdash;&mdash;, where 29 was with 80. He
receiv'd me pretty well, and said 30 and 50 were the causes of my
misfortune and would ruin me. After some hot words against them and
against S., went away in a good humour.</p>
<p>"26. I went to E&mdash;&mdash; and was in danger of being
discover'd by some of Oglethorpe's men that met me accidentally at
the back door of the garden.</p>
<p>"<i>Nov</i> 2. A letter from 29 to be to-morrow at seven at
night at S. and nobody to know it but 80.</p>
<p>"3. He came not, there being an extraordinary council. But 80
brought me a copy of 50's intercepted letter, which made rather for
me than against me. Bid me come to-morrow at the same hour, and to
say nothing of the letter except 29 spake of it first.</p>
<p>"4. I came and found 29 and L. there; he was very kind and gave
me directions how to manage my business and what words I should say
to 39. He appointed 80 to come to me every night until my business
was ripe and promised to send with him directions from time to
time.</p>
<p>"9. L. came from 29 and told me my business should be done to my
mind next week, and that Q. was my friend, and had spoke to 39 and
D. in my behalf; which he said 29 took very kindly and had
expressed so to her. At parting he told me there should be nothing
requir'd of me but what was both safe and honourable. But said
there must be something done to blind 39.</p>
<p>"15. L came to me with a copy of a letter I was to sign to
please 39. I desired to know in whose hands it was to be deposited;
for I would have it in no hands but 29. He told me it should be so;
but if 39 ask'd a copy it could not well be refus'd. I referred
myself entirely to 29's pleasure.</p>
<p>"24. L. came to me from 29 and order'd me to render myself
to-morrow. Cautioned me to play my part, to avoid questions as much
as possible, and to seem absolutely converted to 39's interest. Bad
me bear with some words that might seem harsh.</p>
<p>"25. I render'd myself. At night 29 could not dissemble his
satisfaction; press'd my hand, which I remember not he did before
except when I return'd from the French service. 29 acted his part
well, and I too. 39 and D. seemed not ill pleas'd.</p>
<p>"26. 29 took me aside and falling upon the business of L.R. said
he inclined to have sav'd him but was forc'd to it, otherwise he
must have broke with 39. Bid me think no more on't. Coming home L.
told me he fear'd 39 began to smell out 29's carriage. That
&mdash;&mdash; said to 39 that morning that all that was done was
but sham.</p>
<p>"27. Several told me of the storm that was brewing. Rumsey was
with 39 and was seem to come out crying that he must accuse a man
he lov'd.</p>
<p>"<i>Dec.</i> 19. A letter from 29 bidding me stay till I heard
farther from him.</p>
<p>"<i>Jan.</i> 5. I received a letter from L. marked by 29 in the
margin to trust entirely in 10; and that in February I should
certainly have leave to return. That matters were concerted towards
it; and that 39 had no suspicion, notwithstanding of my reception
here.</p>
<p>"<i>Feb.</i> 8. A letter from L. that my business was almost as
well as done; but must be so sudden as not to leave room for 39's
party to counterplot. That it is probable he would choose Scotland
rather than Flanders or this country; which was all one to 29.</p>
<p>"16. The sad news of his death by L. <i>O cruel fate!</i>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Welwood cautiously adds, in a note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That by 29 and 39 King Charles and the Duke of York seem to be
meant. But I know not what to make of the other numbers and
letters, and must leave the reader to his own conjectures."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There can, I apprehend, be little doubt that the L.R., under the
date of November 26, were meant to indicate the patriotic Lord
Russell.</p>
<p>The whole of these extracts possess the highest interest,
establishing as they do several points referred to by historians.
It is curious to remark the complete subjection in which Charles,
at this period, stood towards his brother; occasioned, perhaps, but
the foreign supplies which he scrupled not to receive, being
dependant on his adhesion to the policy of which the Duke of York
was the avowed representative. Shortly before his death, Charles
appears to have meditated emancipation from this state of thraldom;
and Hume says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He was determined, it is thought, to send the Duke to Scotland,
to recall Monmouth, to summon a parliament, to dismiss all his
unpopular ministers, and to throw himself entirely upon the good
will and affections of his subjects."</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id=
"page399"></a>{399}</span>
<p>This passage accords with the entries in Monmouth's pocket-book
under the dates of Jan. 5. and Feb. 3. If the unfortunate Monmouth
could have foreseen the miserable end, with all its accompanying
humiliations and horrors, to which a few months were destined to
bring him, his exclamation, "O cruel fate!" would have acquired
additional bitterness.</p>
<p class="author">C. ROSS.</p>
<p class="note">[We insert the foregoing as serving to complete the
series of interesting notices connected with the capture of
Monmouth which have appeared in our columns, rather than from an
agreement with the views of our valued correspondent. Dr. Anster
states, that in the pocket-book in his possession, the Duke's
movements up to the 14th March, 1684-5, are given. Would he kindly
settle the question by stating whether the passages quoted by
Weldon are to be found among them?]</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>
<h3>WOOLTON'S CHRISTIAN MANUAL.</h3>
<p>One important use, I conceive, of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" is,
the opportunity it presents of ascertaining the existence of rare
editions of early printed books. Can any of your readers state
where a copy or copies of the following may be found?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Christian Manuell, or the life and maners of true
Christians. A Treatise, wherein is plentifully declared how
needeful it is for the servaunts of God to manifest and declare to
the world: their faith by their deedes, their words by their work,
and their profession by their conversation. Written by Jhon
Woolton, Minister of the Gospel, in the cathedral church of Exetor.
Imprinted at London by J.C. for Tho. Sturruppe, in Paules Church
yarde, at the George, 1576. Dedicated to Sir William Cordell
knight, Maister of the Rolles.&mdash;At Whymple 20 Nouember 1676. N
7, in eights."&mdash;Copy formerly in the possession of Herbert.
(Herbert, <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, vol. ii. p. 1094.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an imperfect copy, I understand, in the Bodleian.
Access to another copy has been needed for an important public
object, in order to transcribe the leaf or leaves wanting in the
Bodleian copy; and the book, so far as I am aware, does not occur
in any other public libraries.</p>
<p>Woolton was nephew to Nowell, author of the <i>Catechisms</i>.
He wrote several other pieces, and was Bishop of Exeter 1579-1593.

<h3>LUTHER'S TRANSLATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT:&mdash;1 JOHN, v.
7.</h3>
<p>In an article of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (vol. xxxiii. p.
78.) on this controverted passage of St. John's Epistles, generally
attributed to the present learned Bishop of Ely, the following
statement is made respecting Luther:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let it also be recollected, to the honour of Luther,
Bugenhagius, and other leaders of the Reformation, that in this
contest they magnanimously stood by the decision of Erasmus.
Luther, in his translation of the New Testament, omitted the
passage; and, in the preface to the last edition (in 1546) revised
by himself, he solemnly requested that his translation should on no
account be altered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since such was the injunction of Luther, how does it happen that
this verse appears in the later editions of his Testament? I have
looked into five or six editions, and have not found the verse in
the two earliest. These bear the following titles:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Biblia dat ys. de gantze hillige Schrifft verd&uuml;deschet
dorch Doct. Mart. Luth. Wittemberch. Hans Lufft. 1579." (in folio.)
"Dat Neu Testamente verd&uuml;deschet d&ouml;rch D. Mart. Luth. mit
den korten Summarien L. Leonharti Hutteri. Gosslar. In Iahre
1619."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse appears in an edition of his Bible printed at Halle in
1719; in his New Testament, Tubingen, 1793; in one printed at Basel
in 1821; and is also to be found in that printed by the Christian
Knowledge Society. In the Basel edition the verse is thus
given;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Denn Drey sind, die de zeugen im Himmel; der Vater, das Wort,
und der beilige Geist; und diese Drey sind Eins."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps some of your learned readers can explain when, and by
whose authority, the verse was inserted in Luther's Testament.</p>
<p class="author">E.M.B.</p>
<p class="note">[We may add, that the verse also appears in the
stereotype edition of Luther's Bible, published by Tauchnitz, at

of Jamaica were not the pirates and robbers that they have been
commonly represented; and mentions, on the authority of a MS.
journal of Sir William Beeston, that Charles II. had a pecuniary
interest in the buccaneering, and continued to receive a share of
the booty after he had publicly ordered the suppression of
buccaneering: and also, speaking of Sir Henry Morgan, and the
honours he received from Charles II., gives an opinion that the
stories told of Morgan's cruelty are untrue. Can any of your
readers tell me who Sir William Beeston was, and what or where his
journal is? or refer me to any accessible information about Charles
II.'s connection with the buccaneers, or that may support Bryan

<p><i>Rawdon Papers.</i>&mdash;The Rev. Mr. Berwick, in introducing
to the public, in 1819, the interesting volume known by the name of
<i>Rawdon Papers</i>, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They are a small part of a correspondence which was left in the
Editor's hands after the greater portion had been sent several
years before to the Marquis of Hastings, whose absence at this time
prevents the Editor's making such additions to his stock as might
render it more interesting to the public."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do these papers still exist in the possession of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>{401}</span> the
Hastings family, and is there any chance of a further publication?
The volume published by Mr. Berwick contains some very interesting
incidental illustrations of the politics, literature, and society
of the seventeenth century, and much might be expected from the
remaining papers. I may add, that this volume has not been so much
used by historians as it should be; but, as was to be expected, it
has not escaped Mr. Macaulay. It is not not well edited.</p>

<p><i>Blockade of Corfe Castle in 1644.</i>&mdash;In Martyn's
<i>Life of Shafetesbury</i> (vol. i. p. 148.) it is stated that a
parliamentary force, under Sir A.A. Cooper, blockaded Corfe Castle
in 1644, after the taking of Wareham. I can find no mention any
where else of an attack on Corfe Castle in 1644. The blockade of
that castle, which Lady Bankes's defence has made memorable, was in
the previous year, and Sir A.A. Cooper had not then joined the
parliament. I should be glad if any of your readers could either
corroborate Martyn's account of a blockade of Corfe Castle in 1644,
or prove it to be, as I am inclined to think it, a
mis-statement.</p>
<p>I should be very thankful for any information as to Sir Anthony
Asteley Cooper's proceedings in Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, and
Somersetshire, during the Civil War and Commonwealth, being engaged
upon a life of Lord Shaftesbury.</p>

<p><i>MSS. of Locke.</i>&mdash;A translation, by Locke, of Nicole's
<i>Essays</i> was published in 1828 by Harvey and Darton, London;
and it is stated in the title-page of the book, that it is printed
from an autograph MS. of Locke, in the possession of Thomas
Hancock, M.D. I wish to know if Dr. Hancock, who also edited the
volume, is still alive? and, if so, would let this querist have
access to the other papers of Locke's which he speaks of in the
preface?</p>

therefore inquire, with some hope of eliciting information, whether
the papers in Mr. Foster's possession, which he has abstained from
publishing, contain any notices of the first Earl of Shaftesbury;
and I am particularly anxious to know whether they contain any
references to the Life of Lord Shaftesbury which Locke meditated,
or throw any light upon the mode in which Locke would have become
possessed of some suppressed passages of Edmund Ludlow's
memoirs.</p>

<p><i>Theses.</i>&mdash;Many German works introduced into
Catalogues, are <i>theses</i> defended at the universities. The
name of the <i>President</i> is generally first, and in larger
letters than that of the propounder, who is usually the author.
Hence, it often happens, that the <i>Thesis</i> is entered as a
work written by the <i>Pr&aelig;ses</i>. But is not unfrequently
happened, that this Pr&aelig;ses was <i>really</i> the author; and
that, as an easy way of publishing his thought, he entrusted an
essay to a candidate for a degree, to be defended by him. The
seventh rule of the Museum Catalogue runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The respondent or defender in a thesis to be considered its
author, except when it unequivocally appears to be the work of the
Pr&aelig;ses."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I would ask, what are the usual signs of the authorship?
Are there any catalogues of Theses? Any bibliographical works which
contain hints for guidance in this matter? Any correspondents who
can advise generally on the whole matter?</p>

<p><i>Emancipation of the Jews.</i>&mdash;In Francis' <i>History of

part of the Jews to pay 500,000<i>l.</i> to the state on the
following conditions;&mdash;1. That the laws against them should be
repealed; 2. That the Bodleian Library should be assigned to them;
3. That they should have permission to use St. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>{402}</span> Paul's
Cathedral as a Synagogue. It is stated, on the authority of a
letter in the Thurloe State Papers, that this proposition was
actually discussed. The larger sum of 800,000<i>l.</i> was
demanded; but, being refused, the negotiation was broken off. This
proposition is said to have been made shortly before the elevation
of Cromwell to the Protectorate. The subject is an interesting one
in these days, when Jewish disabilities are under discussion.</p>
<p>I wish to offer two queries:&mdash;1. Is this story confirmed by
any contemporary writer? 2. Is it conceivable that the Jews would
have consented to worship in a <i>cruciform</i> church, such as was
old St. Paul's, which was standing at the time this offer is
supposed to have been made?</p>

the Query as to the "Latin Names of Towns" in titles, referred your

is right your readers should know that the information therein
given must only be taken as suggestive, and sometimes as
dismissible upon reference to the commonest gazetteer. I opened at
the letter N; and found, that of three entries, the first my eye
lighted upon, two were palpably wrong. The first informs us that
"N&aelig;ostadium <i>in Palatinatu</i>" is in "France;" the third
that "Nellore" is in "<i>Ceylon</i>." I am bound to say that I do
not find errors so thickly scattered throughout, and that the list
will be useful to me. But, Query, is there any thing extensive of
which the accuracy can be depended upon?</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>SCALA COELI.</h3>
<p>I incline to think that the testator whose will is referred to
in No. 23. p. 336., by "Scala Coeli," meant King Henry the
Seventh's Chapel at Westminster.</p>
<p>Margaret Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother to King Henry
VII., in the indenture for founding Chantry Monks in the Abbey of
Westminster, dated 2. March, 21 Henry VII. (1506-6), states that
she had obtained papal bulls of indulgence, that all persons saying
and hearing her chantry masses should have as full remission from
sin as in the place called <i>Scala Coeli</i> beside Rome, "to the
great comfort and relief of the said Monasterie and all Cristen
people resorting thereto." (<i>MS. Lansd.</i> 444.)</p>
<p>Henry Lord Marney, by his will, dated 22d Dec., 15 Hen. VIII.
(1523), directs a trental of masses to be "first at Scala Coeli, in
Westminster." (<i>Testamenta Vetusta</i>, 609.)</p>
<p>Blomefield (<i>Hist. of Norfolk</i>, 8vo. edit., iv. 60)
speaking of the Church of the Augustine Friars at Norwich,
observes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That which brought most profit to the convent, was the chapel
of Our Lady in this church, called Scala Celi, to which people were
continually coming in pilgrimage, and offering at the altar there;
most folks desiring to have masses sung for them here, or to be
buried in the cloister of Scala Celi, that they might be partakers
of the many pardons and indulgences granted by the Popes to this
place; this being the only chapel (except that of the same name at
Westminster, and that of Our Lady in St. Buttolph's church at
Boston,) that I find to have the same privileges and indulgences as
the chapel of Scala Celi at Rome; which were so great as made all
the three places aforesaid so much frequented; it being easier to
pay their devotions here, than go so long a journey; all which
indulgences and pardons may be seen in Fox's <i>Acts and
Monuments</i>, fo. 1075."</p>

<h3>WATCHING THE SEPULCHRE.</h3>
<p>"T.W." (No. 20. p. 218.) will find no end of "Items" for
watching the sepulchre, in the "Churchwardens' Accounts" before the
Reformation, and during the reign of Queen Mary. At Easter it was
the custom to erect a sepulchre on the north side of the chancel,
to represent that of our Saviour. This was generally a temporary
structure of wood; though in some churches there still remain
elaborately ornamented ones of stone. Sometimes the founder's tomb
was used for the purpose. In this sepulchre was placed on Good
Friday the crucifix, and occasionally the host, with other emblems;
and a person was employed to watch it till the morning of Easter
Day, when it was taken out with great ceremony, in imitation of our
Lord's resurrection. It was the payment for this watching that
occurs continually in the Churchwardens' Accounts, and of which, it
appears, Fuller could not understand the meaning. A paper on the
subject of Easter sepulchres, by Mr. Venables, was read at the
meeting of the Cambridge Camden Society in March, 1843, but I am
not aware whether it has been printed. Some very curious "Items" on
this subject are given in Britton's <i>Redcliffe Church</i>, which
are quoted in the <i>Oxford Glossary of Architecture</i>. They are
so illustrative, that I subjoin them, to give you an opportunity,
if you please, of serving them up to your readers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Item, That Maister Canynge hath deliver'd, this 4th day of
July, in the year of Our Lord 1470, to Maister Nicholas Petters,
Vicar of St. Mary Redcliffe, Moses Conterin, Philip Barthelmew,
Procurators of St. Mary Redcliffe aforesaid, a new sepulchre, well
gilt with gold, and a civer thereto.</p>
<p>"Item, An image of God Almighty rising out of the same
sepulchre, with all the ordinance that 'longeth thereto; that is to
say, a lathe made of timber and the iron work thereto.</p>
<p>"Item, Thereto 'longeth Heaven, made of timber and stained
clothes.</p>
<p>"Item, Hell, made of timber, and the iron-work thereto, with
Divels to the number of 13.</p>
<p>"Item, 4 knights, armed, keeping the sepulchre, with their
weapons in their hands; that is to say, 2 axes and 2 spears, with 2
pav&eacute;s.</p>
<p>"Item, 4 payr of angels' wings for 4 angels, made of timber and
well painted.</p>
<p>"Item, The Fadre, the crown and visage, the ball with a cross
upon it, well gilt with fine gould.</p>
<p>"Item, The Holy Ghost coming out of Heaven into the
sepulchre.</p>
<p>"Item, 'Longeth to the 4 angels 4 chevelers."</p>

<p>"<i>Watching the Sepulchre</i>" (No. 20. p. 318.).&mdash;At the
present day, in most Roman Catholic countries it is the custom to
exhibit in the principal churches at this period, and at Christmas,
a kind of <i>tableau</i> of the entombment and of the birth of the
Saviour. The figures are sometimes small, and at other times the
size of life: generally coloured, and formed of wax, wood, stone,
or other materials; and when artistically arranged, and judiciously
lighted, form sometimes beautiful objects. I have no doubt the
entry in the Churchwardens' Accounts of Waltham Abbey refers to a
custom of the same kind, prevailing in the country before the
Reformation. If the date of their entry were sought for, I have
little doubt but that it would be found to have been about Easter.
The <i>sepulchre</i> itself was often, I believe, a permanent
erection of stone, and some of them probably now remain in the
churches of England on the north side of the chancel, where they
may sometimes be taken for the tombs of individuals there
interred.</p>
<p class="author">W.C. TREVELYAN.</p>
<p><i>Watching the Sepulchre.</i>&mdash;In reply to "T.W.'s" Query
in No. 20., I have witnessed at Florence the custom of dressing the
sepulchre on the Thursday before Good Friday with the most
beautiful flowers, many of which are reared especially for the
purpose. The devout attend at the sepulchre, and make their prayers
there throughout the day, the most profound silence being observed.
The convents rival each other in the beauty of their
decorations.</p>
<p>Do you think that the Churchwardens' entries in Fuller can refer
to a similar custom?</p>
<p>The loveliness of the flowers, and their delightful perfume,
which pervades the church, present a most soothing and agreeable
type of death and the grave, under their Christian phase. I was
always at a loss to understand why this was done on Thursday,
instead of on Saturday; the latter being the day on which Our Lord
rested in the sepulchre.</p>

<h3>QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 7.</h3>
<p>A new <i>blunder</i> of Mr. Malone.&mdash;I love the memory of
Edmond Malone, albeit he sometimes committed blunders. He committed
a pitiable blunder when he broke his bow in shooting at the
worthless Samuel Ireland; and he committed an <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>{404}</span>
irreparable blunder when he whitewashed the monumental effigy of
the matchless Shakspere. Of the blunder ascribed to him by a
reverend querist (No. 14. p. 213) he was quite innocent.</p>
<p>Before we censure an author or editor, we should consult his
<i>own</i> edition. He cannot be answerable for the errors of any
other impression. Such, at least, is <i>my</i> notion of critical
equity.</p>
<p>I shall now state the plain facts. Malone, in the first
instance, printed the spurious declaration of John <i>Shakspear</i>
in an <i>imperfect state</i>. (<i>Plays and Poems of W.S.</i>,
1790, vol. i. part ii. p. 162.) He was soon afterwards enabled to
complete it. (<i>Ibid.</i> vol. i. part ii. p. 330.) Steevens
reprinted it entire, and without comment. (<i>Plays of W.S.</i>,
1793, vol. ii. p. 300.) Now the editor of the Irish reimpression,
who must have omitted to consult the edition of Steevens, merely
committed a <i>blunder</i> in attempting to unite the two fragments
as first published by Mr. Malone.</p>
<p>There was no <i>audacious fabrication</i> on the
occasion&mdash;there is no <i>mystery</i> in the case! (No. 24. p.
386.) So, to stop the current of misconception, and economise space
on future occasions, I venture to repeat a few words in suggesting
as a canon of criticism:&mdash;<i>Before we censure an author or
editor we should consult his</i> own <i>edition</i>.</p>

and verses) in Foxe's <i>Acts and Monuments</i>; a portion once
peculiar to the first edition of 1563, p. 452., but now appearing

service in the absence of the original tract.</p>

<p><i>Hordys</i> (No. 5. p. 157.).&mdash;I have waited till now in
hopes of seeing an answer from some more competent pen than my own
to the Query as to the meaning of the word "<i>hordys</i>," by your
correspondent "J.G.;" but having been disappointed, I venture a
suggestion which occurred to me immediately on reading it, viz.
that "<i>hordys</i>" might be some possible or impossible
derivation from <i>hordeum</i>, and applied "irreverently" to the
consecrated host, as though it were no better than a common
barley-cake.</p>
<p>Whether in those early days and in Ireland, the host was really
made of barley, and whether "hordys" was a name given to some kind
of barley-cake then in vogue, or (supposing my suggestion to be
well founded) a word coined for the occasion, may perhaps be worthy
of investigation.</p>

<p><i>Eachard's Tracts.</i>&mdash;The Rev. George Wyatt, who
inquires (No. 20. p. 320.) about Eachard's <i>Tracts</i>, will
probably get all the information he wants from the Life of Eachard
prefixed to the collected edition of his <i>Works</i> in three
volumes, which I am sorry I have not the means at present of
referring to.</p>
<p>"I.O.," to whom the last of the tracts is addressed, is Dr. John
Owen.</p>
<p>Philatus (what objection is there to Latinising, in the usual
way, the Greek termination os?) is, of course, intended for Hobbes;
and, to convey Eachard's opinion of him, his opponent in the
Dialogue is Timothy, a God-honourer.</p>
<p>Let me add, as you have headed Mr. Wyatt's communication "Tracts
attributed to Eachard," thereby casting a doubt upon his
authorship, that there is no doubt about Dr. John Eachard being the
author of all the tracts which Mr. Wyatt enumerates; nor was there
any concealment by Eachard. His authorship of the <i>Grounds and
Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy</i> is notorious. The
"Epistle Dedicatory," signed "J.E.," mentioned by Mr. Wyatt as
prefixed to the Dialogue on Hobbes' <i>State of Nature</i>, refers
also to the five subsequent letters. These were published at the
same time with the Dialogue on Hobbes, in one volume, and are
answers to attacks on the <i>Grounds and Occasions</i>, &amp;c. The
Epistle Dedicatory is addressed to Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of
Canterbury, "and," says Eachard, "I hope my dialogue will not find
the less acceptance with your Grace for these Letters which follow
after."</p>
<p>The second edition of the volume I have by me, published in
1672: the title, <i>Mr. Hobbes's State of Nature considered,

Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy."</i></p>

<p><i>The Wickliffite Version of the Scriptures.</i>&mdash;I have
in my possession a very fair MS. of Wickliff's translation of the
New Testament; and should the editors of the Wickliffite Versions
like to see my MS., and let me know to whom I may send it, I shall
be happy to lend it them.</p>

<p><i>Hever</i> (pp. 269. 342.).&mdash;In confirmation of the
meaning assigned to this word, there is an estate near Westerham,
in Kent, called "Hever's-wood."</p>
<p class="author">S.S.S.</p>
<p><i>Steward Family</i> (No. 21. p. 335.).&mdash;Though not an
answer to his question, "O.C." may like to be informed that the
arms of the impalement in the drawing which he describes are
(according to Izacke's <i>Exeter</i>) those which were borne by
Ralph Taxall, Sheriff of Devon, in 1519. Pole calls him Texshall.
Modern heralds give the coat to Pecksall of Westminster. If a
conjecture may be hazarded, I would suggest that the coat was a
modification of the ancient arms of Batishull: a crosslet in
saltier, between four owls.</p>
<p class="author">S.S.S.</p>
<p><i>Gloves</i> (No. 5. p. 72.).&mdash;In connection with the
subject of the presentation of gloves, I would refer your
correspondents to the curious scene in Vicar's <i>Parliamentary
Chronicle</i>, where "Master Prynne," on his visit to Archbishop
Laud in the Tower in May 1643, accepts "a fair pair of gloves, upon
the Archbishop's extraordinary pressing importunity;" a present
which, under the disagreeable circumstances of the interview, seems
to have been intended to convey an intimation beyond that of mere
courtesy.</p>
<p class="author">S.S.S.</p>
<p><i>Cromlech.</i>&mdash;As your learned correspondent "Dr. TODD"
(No. 20. p. 319.) queries this word, I think it is very doubtful
whether the word was in use, or not, before the period mentioned
(16th century). Dr. Owain Pughe considered the word "cromlech"
(<i>crwm-llech</i>, an inclined or flat stone,) to be merely a
popular name, having no reference to the original purpose of the
structure. The only Triadic name that will apply to the cromlechs,
is <i>maen ketti</i> (stone chests, or arks), the raising of which
is described as one of "The three mighty labours of the Isle of
Britain."</p>
<p class="author">GOMER.</p>
<p><i>Watewich</i> (pp. 60. 121. 236.).&mdash;May not "Watewich" be
Waterbeach?</p>
<p class="author">S.S.S.</p>
<p>"<i>By Hook or by Crook.</i>"&mdash;I imagine that the
expression "By hook or by crook" is in very general use throughout
England. It was familiar to my ear forty years ago in Surrey, and
within these four years its origin was (to my satisfaction at the
moment) brought home to my comprehension in the North of Devon,
where the tenant of a certain farm informed me that, by an old
custom, he was entitled to take wood from some adjoining land
"<i>by hook and crook</i>;" which, on inquiry, I understood to
include, first, so much underwood as he could cut with the
<i>hook</i> or bill, and, secondly, so much of the branches of
trees as he could pull down with the aid of a <i>crook</i>.</p>
<p>Whether this crook originally meant the shepherd's crook (a very
efficient instrument for the purpose), or simply such a
<i>crook</i>-ed <i>stick</i> as boys use for gathering hazel-nuts,
is not very material. It seems highly probable that, in the vast
forests which once overspread this country, the right of taking
"<i>fire bote</i>" by "hook or crook" was recognised; and we can
hardly wish for a more apt illustration of the idea of gaining a
desired object by the ordinary means&mdash;"a hook," if it lay
close to our hand; or, by a method requiring more effort, "a
crook," if it were a little beyond our reach.</p>
<p class="author">J.A.S.</p>
<p><i>By Hook or by Crook</i> (pp. 205, 237. 281.
&amp;c.).&mdash;In confirmation of this phrase having reference to
forest customs, my hind told me that my plantations were plundered
by hook or by crook, and he and I once caught a man in <i>flagrante
delicto</i>, with a hook for cutting green wood, and a crook at the
end of a long pole for breaking off dry branches, which could not
be otherwise reached. For an early use of the term, see Bacon's
<i>Fortress of the Faithful</i>, 1550.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whatsoever is pleasant or profitable must be theirs by hook or
by crook."</p>

<p><i>Lines on Pharaoh</i> (No. 19. p. 298.).&mdash;I beg to inform
"J.T.," that the well-known <i>couplet</i> about Pharaoh, and
<i>rascal</i> rhyming to <i>pascal</i>, are from a certain
<i>History of the Bible</i>, or <i>Bible History</i>, by the Rev.
Dr. Zachary Boyd, of Todrig, who was either Principal or Professor
of Divinity at Glasgow in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>He left considerable property to the College there, on condition
that his bust should be placed in the quadrangle, and his great
work printed under the care of the Academical Senatus. The bust was
placed accordingly, and is, or lately was, to be seen in a niche
over the inner doorway. The <i>History</i> was also printed, it is
said, but never published. However, curious visitors have always, I
believe, been allowed a peep into it&mdash;whether the MS. or the
solitary printed book, I am not sure&mdash;and a few choice morsels
are current. I recollect one stave of the lamentation of
Jonah&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Lord! what a doleful place is this!</p>
<p class="i2">There's neither coal nor candle;</p>
<p>And nothing I but fishes' tripes</p>
<p class="i2">And greasy guts do bandle."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I think it a shame that the Maitland Club of Glasgow has not,
ere now, volunteered an edition of Zachary's immortal performance.
The <i>Senatus</i> would hardly object (if the expense were
undertaken), as the circulation would be confined to true
Scots.</p>
<p class="author">PHILOBODIUS.</p>
<p class="note">[The following communication from a very competent
authority, and the very passage quoted by "PHILOBODIUS" himself,
quite justify the non-publication of Zachary's doggrel.]</p>
<p><i>Zachary Boyd</i> (No. 19. p. 298.).&mdash;Your notice of
Zachary Boyd, and his extraordinary paraphrase of the Bible in the
College at Glasgow, has reminded me of my having examined that
strange work, and found ample cause for its not being published,
though a sufficient sum was bequeathed for that purpose. The whole
doggrel is only calculated to bring ridicule and contempt upon the
Scriptures; but there are, besides, passages such as refer to Job's
"Curse God, and die;" to Jeshuram waxing fat; to Jonah in the
whale's belly; and other parts, which utterly unfit the MS. for
decent perusal.</p>
<p class="author">W. JERDAN.</p>
<p><i>Welsh Ambassador.</i>&mdash;The origin of the word "Welsh,"
from the Saxon "Wealh," a stranger, and the use of it in this sense
by our old writers (see Brady's <i>Introd.</i>, p. 5.: Sir T.
Smith's <i>Commonwealth of England</i>, chap. xiii.), sufficiently
explain this designation of the Cuckoo, the temporary resident of
our cold climate, and the ambassador <i>extraordinary</i> in the
revolutions of the seasons, in the words of the Nursery
Rhymes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"She comes as a <i>stranger</i>, and stays three months in the
year."</p>
<p>"Quid tibi vis aliud dicam? me <i>vox mea prodit</i>."</p>
<p><i>Alciati, Emblema</i> lx. <i>Cuculi, Comment</i>.</p>

<p class="author">T.J.</p>
<p><i>Prince Madoc.</i>&mdash;I was much gratified on reading
"T.T.'s" note, commenting on my observations respecting the Mandan
language, as he proves the existence of Celtic words amongst the
American Indians. Regarding "T.T.'s" doubts as to the Mandans being
descended from the followers of Madoc, I confess that my opinions
on the point do not differ very widely from his own. The
circumstances attending Madoc's emigration, in the paucity of its
numbers and the entire separation from the mother country, with the
character of the Indians, would almost ensure the ultimate
destruction of the settlement, or the ultimate absorption of its
remains by those who might have had friendly relations with the
Welsh. In this most favourable view, the evidences of the presence
of the Welsh seven centuries since would be few indeed at the
present day. The most striking circumstance of this nature that I
met with in Mr. Catlin's work, is a description of what he calls a
"bull-boat," from its being covered with a bull's hide, which, in
construction and form, is perfectly identical with the Welsh
"<i>cwrygl</i>." Yet, strong as this resemblance is, it will have
but little weight if unsupported by other evidence. In conclusion,
I would observe, that I never supposed Prince Madoc to be the
discover of America, but that his voyage was induced by the
knowledge that other lands existed in the great ocean (<i>see</i>
Humboldt's <i>Examen critique</i>). The emblems found in America,
and said to be crosses, are obviously the <i>tau</i> [cross
symbol], or symbol of life, and can have no connection with
Christianity.</p>

<p><i>Poghell</i> (No. 12. p. 186.).&mdash;In Cornwall and Devon
there are places called Poughill or Poghill,&mdash;in
<i>Domesday</i>, Pochelle; and in the <i>Taxatio Ecclesiastica</i>,
Pockehulle and Pogheheulle. The etymology of the word, I take to be
merely the addition (as is often found) of the Anglo-Saxon
<i>hill</i>, or <i>hull</i>, to the old Teutonic word Pock, or Pok,
an eruption or protrusion. In low Latin, Pogetum is colliculus.
(See Ducange.)</p>

<p><i>Swingeing Tureen</i> (No. 19. p. 211., and No. 21. p.
340.).&mdash;How could "SELEUCUS" "conclude" that Goldsmith's "Poor
Beau Tibbs and Kitty his Wife," should have had "a <i>silver</i>
tureen" of expensive construction? It is evident that "Kitty's"
husband, in the "Haunch of Venison," was the Beau Tibbs of the
"Citizen of the World." There can be no doubt that, however the
word be spelled, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id=
"page407"></a>{407}</span> the meaning is <i>swingeing</i>, "huge,
great," which I admit was generally, if not always, in those days
spelled swinging, as in Johnson&mdash;"<i>Swinging</i>, from
<i>swinge, huge, great</i>;" but which ought to be, as it is
pronounced, <i>swingeing</i>.</p>
<p><i>Tureen</i> (pp. 246. 307. 340.).&mdash;"And instead of soup
in a China terrene." (Knox, Essay 57 <i>Works</i>. vol. ii. p.

<p><i>"A" or "An."&mdash;Quem Deus vult perdere.</i>&mdash;Allow me
to refer your correspondents "PRISCIAN" and "E.S. JACKSON" (of No.
22.), to the <i>Selections from the Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
London, 1814, vol. ii. pp. 333. and 162., for some interesting
papers on the subjects of their respective inquiries.</p>
<p>The paper first referred to, at p. 333., is certainly well worth
perusal, as the writer, "KUSTER," has examined the question with
considerable care, and proves, by many curious instances, that most
of those whom we have been taught to look up to as the greatest
authorities in English writing&mdash;Dryden, Swift, Pope, Johnson,
and others&mdash;seem to have had no fixed rule on the subject, but
to have used "a" or "an" before the same words with the most
reckless inconsistency.</p>
<p>The second paper, at p. 162., gives a more detailed account of
the adage, "Quem Deus (potius <i>Jupiter</i>) vult perdere,"
&amp;c., than "F.C.B." (whose object, of course, was rather to
compare <i>results</i> than to trace <i>derivations</i>) has
supplied in his interesting communication.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
